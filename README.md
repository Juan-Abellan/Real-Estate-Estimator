# Real-Estate-Estimator

## Background & Objectives

In this challenge, you will learn how to setup and solve a linear algebra problem using matrix inversion with numpy, in order to implement your first estimator of real estate prices.
We will try to figure out whether there exists a ***LINEAR RELATIONSHIP*** between :
- the **price** of a flat (our **target** for each flat)
- and some usual **features** such as like surface area, bedrooms, etc...
- 
## Data
Suppose that we were able to collect data for 4 flats down below: 
- their **features**:
    - `surface` (square feet)
    - `bedrooms`
    - `floors` 
- their **target**:
    - `price` (in thousands of USD)

|flats |surface (square feet)|bedrooms|floors|price (k USD)|
|------|-------------|--------|------|------------|
|flat1 |620|1|1|244|
|flat2 |3280|4|2|671|
|flat3 |1900|2|2|504|
|flat4 |1320|3|3|510|


## Tools
For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as numpy.
